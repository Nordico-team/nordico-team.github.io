# Trype team
Founded in 2019 in Odense, in the island of Fyn, Trype is a young Danish startup. We believe that “to travel is to live", and thus our mission is to bring people together with the best travel plans.

Powered by Artificial Intelligence, Trype's engine accesses big databases of flights and hotels and puzzles together memorable trips at the best price.

Our policy is transparency and price competitiveness: Our platform is free to use and we don´t charge you commissions on our packages. We aim to always provide you with clear information and find for you the best discounts and travel opportunities.
